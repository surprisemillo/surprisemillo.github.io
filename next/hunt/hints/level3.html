        <p style="font-size: 30px;">The small door opens and you see a library, your secret library, an extremely large room with a high roof and fret worked walls and roof. There's a big globe, a writing desk, some paintings, a magnificent fireplace, carpets, a vinyl record player, and a few chairs on the colourful ceramic flooe. The library possesses  thousands of cupboards and endless books with some staircases and ladders that lead people to the higher shelves of books.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">You scream in joy and start running towards the books when you notice the writing desk.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">A nearly empty desk, with a piece of paper placed in the middle, kept as if it were waiting for you.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">You go near the paper and pick it up, but you see nothing, you try different things and yet nothing, dejected and you are about to throw the paper in the fireplace, when notice letters emerging.</p>
