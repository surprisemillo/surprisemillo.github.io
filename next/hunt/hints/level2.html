        <p style="font-size: 30px;">After your walk in Mira Silva, the girl gets up and starts walking towards you, she comes in front of you and wishes you a Happy Half Birthday! and asks you to follow her</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">You get confused, but with your newly found passion: completing this hunt ofcourse, you start following her.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">She leads you to a door and opens it for you, where you see a Great Hall with sticks of wax floating and covering the entire ceiling, you notice a few unlit candles that lead you to a small door.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">The girl nods at you, confirming your thoughts and tells you to carry a few candles, to give light to <b>the room with the most untold stories</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">You reach the door, and the door speaks, <b>"What Room Do You Wish to Enter?"</b></p>
