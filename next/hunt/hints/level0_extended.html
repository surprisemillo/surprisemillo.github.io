        <p style="font-size: 35px;">You hear the door rattle and the lock makes a loud click, yet when you go to open the door it wonâ€™t budge. 
            You stare at the door in confusion, <b>the spell worked, right?</b> You try it again, but the door will not open. 
            You listen closely, at first you hear nothing and when you're about to turn around you hear it; a soft whisper. 
            You raise your eyebrows, since you've never heard a door whisper before. You lean closer to the door 
            and put your ear to the keyhole, <b>"Password, please."</b> it clearly whispers. You try Alohomora again, but nothing happens. 
            <b>"Close"</b>, the door whispers, <b>"But not quite correct.."</b></p>
